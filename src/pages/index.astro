					In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TED has created a
					program called TEDx. TEDx is a program of local,
					self-organized events that bring people together to share a
					TED-like experience. Our event is called TEDx[name], where x
					= independently organized TED event. At our TEDx[name]
					event, TED Talks video and live speakers will combine to
					spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. The
					TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx
					program, but individual TEDx events, including ours, are
					self-organized.
