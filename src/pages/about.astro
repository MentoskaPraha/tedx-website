						About TEDx
					</h2>
					<p class="text-justify">
						In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a
						program of local, self-organized events that bring
						people together to share a TED-like experience. At a
						TEDx event, TED Talks video and live speakers combine to
						spark deep discussion and connection. These local,
						self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x =
						independently organized TED event. The TED Conference
						provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but
						individual TEDx events are self-organized. (Subject to
						certain rules and regulations.)
