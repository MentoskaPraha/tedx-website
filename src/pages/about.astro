						What is TEDx?
					</h2>
					<p class="text-justify">
						In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TED has created
						a program called TEDx. TEDx is a program of local,
						self-organized events that bring people together to
						share a TED-like experience. Our event is called
						TEDx[name], where x = independently organized TED event.
						At our TEDx[name] event, TED Talks video and live
						speakers will combine to spark deep discussion and
						connection in a small group. The TED Conference provides
						general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual
						TEDx events, including ours, are self-organized.
